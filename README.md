### About LinkAce

### :bulb: Support for LinkAce

I built LinkAce to solve my own problem, and I now offer my solution and code without charging any money. I spent a lot of my free time building this application, so I won't offer any *free* personal support, customization or installation help. If you need help please visit the [community discussions](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/discussions) and post your issue there.
