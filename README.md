### :bulb: Support for LinkAce

I built LinkAce to solve my own problem, and I now offer my solution and code without charging any money. I spent a lot of my free time building this application, so I won't offer any *free* personal support, customization or installation help. If you need help please visit the [community discussions](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/discussions) and post your issue there.

:star: You can get personal and dedicated support by **becoming a supporter on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/linkace), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Kovah) or [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/Kovah)**.
