# Note on using secrets stored in files
# If you'd like, you may also store secrets in files. This is useful when managing secrets in a cluster environment.
# Each environment variable that is for a password, access key or secret access key may have "_FILE" appended. The
# file will be read and its contents used.
# Example:
# REDIS_PASSWORD_FILE=/var/run/secrets/redis-password
